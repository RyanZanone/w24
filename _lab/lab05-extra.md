# Introduction

This is an _optional_ extra-credit lab that was announced in class during [Lecture 12]({{ site.slides_url }}).

You can work alone or in pairs; if working in pairs, make sure that both partners' names appear in the code file and on Gradescope (use the "add" button to include both names).

* Create a queue simulation for the office hours that is based on the Printer Queue simulation in the textbook (hardcover Section 3.4.5)
* Include a `README.txt` to explain your assumptions, formulas, results
* Include a `cs9extracredit.py` that contains code for the simulation that produces the results outlined in the `README.txt` file

Here is a list of things to think about that will help you get started.

The book has a simulation of a physical printer and a queue for print jobs.
In a similar manner, you should should create a simulation for office hours. (You should simulate the act of waiting for and getting help from a professor/TA/ULA.)
- Consider which metrics are important for this simulation.
- What kind of events or actions do you need to simulate?
- What kind of data do you need to make the simulation work?
- What kind of output would be useful to someone running the simulation? 
- What kind of recommendations would you make to students or the teaching staff based on the results of your simulation?

Look at the bookâ€™s printing simulation as an inspiration for what to do, but since office hours and printing are different problems, your code will be different.

The instructions are intentionally left open to interpretation, as it is an exercise in modelling real world problems with code. For most problems we solve as software engineers, there is rarely one perfect implementation to solve a problem. That is why we are having you practice developing and documenting your own solution.
