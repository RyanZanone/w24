# Introduction

This is an _optional_ extra-credit lab that was announced in class during [Lecture 12]({{ site.slides_url }}).

You can work alone or in pairs; if working in pairs, make sure that both partners' names appear in the code file and on Gradescope (use the "add" button to include both names).

* Create a queue simulation for the office hours that is based on the Printer Queue simulation in the textbook (hardcover Section 3.4.5)
* Include a `README.txt` to explain your assumptions, formulas, results
* Include a `cs9extracredit.py` that contains code for the simulation that produces the results outlined in the `README.txt` file
