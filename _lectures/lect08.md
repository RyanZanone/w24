# Plan for today

- Outline helpful ways to study for the midterm
- Discuss Algorithm Analysis
    - What is benchmarking and asymptotic analysis?
    - How is the Order of Magnitude (Big-O) different from them?
- Work through algorithm examples
    - Use the iClicker Cloud: https://student.iclicker.com/ 
    - Given an algorithm, what do we do to figure out its Big-O?
- What are the differences between Python lists and dictionaries?

See slides and the recording for additional notes.
