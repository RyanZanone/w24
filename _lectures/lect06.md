# Plan for today

* Define a parent class
* Define derived classes
* Write the corresponding test classes and methods
* Run the tests in pytest 


# Inheritance

* Avoids code duplication (similar to the idea of functions)
* Allows us to extend the existing code and use existing methods

* Start with the **base class** (also referred to as a **parent class** or a **super class**)
* The classes that inherit from the base class, are referred to as the **child** / **derived** / **sub-class**.

For pytest:
* a test file's name has to start with `test_` (pytest won't recognize it otherwise)
* the convention in this class is that function names will also start with `test_`
* Need to run pytest on the Command Line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows)

* Let's write an `Animal` class and see what inheritance looks like in action:

```
# Animal.py
class Animal:
	''' Animal class type that contains attributes for all animals '''

def __init__(self, species=None, name=None):
	self.species = species
	self.name = name

def setName(self, name):
	self.name = name

def setSpecies(self, species):
	self.species = species

def info(self):
	return f"Species: {self.species}, Name: {self.name}"

def getSound(self):
	return "I'm an Animal!!!"
```

* Let's define a `Cow` class that inherits from `Animal`

```
# Cow.py

from Animal import Animal

class Cow(Animal):
    # Available method for the Cow Class 
    def setSound(self, sound):
        self.sound = sound
```

and instantiate a specific cow:
```
mycow = Cow("cow", "Betsy")
print(mycow.info())
mycow.setSound("Moo") # Sets a Cow sound attribute to "Moo"
print(mycow.getSound()) # I’m an Animal!!! (calls the `Animal.getSound` method)
```

* Note that the Cow’s constructor (`__init__`) was inherited from the class `Animal` as well as the `info()` method
* Also note that we didn’t need to define the `getSound()` method since it was inherited from `Animal`
* But in this case, this inherited method `getSound()` may not be what we want.
* So we can redefine its functionality in the Cow class!

```
# in Cow class
def getSound(self):
	return f"{self.sound}!"
```

* We changed the `getSound()` method in the `Cow` class, so in this case our `Cow` class overrode the `getSound()` method of `Animal`
* So now, cow objects will use its own version of `getSound()`, not the version that was inherited from `Animal`, as seen below:

```
mycow = Cow("cow", "Betsy")
mycow.setSound("Moo") # Sets a Cow sound to "Moo"
print(mycow.getSound()) # Moo!
```

* We can still create `Animal` objects, and `Animal` objects will still use its own version of `getSound()`

```
rarebird = Animal("phoenix", "Zarra")
print(rarebird.info())
print(rarebird.getSound()) # I’m an Animal!!!
```
We can also modify/override methods from the parent class while still using pieces of its functionality
```
# Cow.py

from Animal import Animal

class Cow(Animal):
    def __init__(self, species=None, name=None, sound=None):
	super().__init__(species, name) 
	self.sound = sound 
	# Animal.__init__(self, species, name) is an alternate method seen in the textbook
```
* The `Cow` constructor uses the `Animal` constructor to set the `species` and `name` attributes with the `super()` method
* The `sound` attribute, which is unique to the `Cow` class, is set as you normally would
  
<b>Note:</b> The constructed object type will dictate which method in which class is called.
* It first looks at the <b>constructed object type</b> and checks if there is a method defined in that class. If so, it uses that method
* If the constructed object doesn’t have a method definition in its class, then it checks the immediate parent(s) it inherited from, and so on ...
* If there is no matching method call, then an error happens
